# Homework 1
First homework due 9.17.2020

In ReadMe, explain briefly your project, your goals and methods. Also explain how and where did you get the data. Finally in ReadMe you should describe how a potential reader should navigate in this Github Repo.
## Overview
Major League Baseball has existed for almost 150 years. Largely, the rules of the game have remained consistent, however strategies have changed. The goal of my project is to show how pitching in particular has changed through the years. I believe today's pitchers are ptiching less innings per game in an effort to preserve their arms from being injured. My hypothesis is that the number of complete games per season, a stat indicating a pitcher has pitched all innings of the entire game, has decreased over time.
